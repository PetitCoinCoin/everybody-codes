For Q1P3, I thought "6 among 20 is only 38â€¯760 possibilities, this shouldn't take to long!". But I forgot the permutations too XD. Nevertheless, I didn't have time to find a clever solution now (it appears I'm supposed to work), so let's go bruteforcing and let it run... but it completed in about 90sec!

Of course Q2P3 wouldn't be possible with bruteforce! Thought of linked list, but it seemed worst than my naive approach. I thought of recursion (but this made no sense). And I remembered about deque. Since it's based on linked list I assume my first implementation wasn't right. Anyway, it runs in about 10sec. It could probably be improved.
I kept my solution for part 2 for archive purpose, but of course it could be replaced (using the deque solution reduce about 30% runtime)
