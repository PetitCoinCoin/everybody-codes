For Q1P3, I thought "6 among 20 is only 38â€¯760 possibilities, this shouldn't take to long!". But I forgot the permutations too XD. Nevertheless, I didn't have time to find a clever solution now (it appears I'm supposed to work), so let's go bruteforcing and let it run... but it completed in about 90sec!
